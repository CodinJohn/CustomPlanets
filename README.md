# Summary
Custom Planets is a web application where users can create, manage, and explore their own custom planets along with viewing the custom planets of others! Each user can sign up for an account, log in, create planets, and view planets created by other users in the community. 

# Stretch Goals
I would love to add a comments are where users can give feedback on the planets created and a like section. I would also love to change the sign in portion to add two worlds where the sign-in and sign-up buttons would live almost like floating Earth's. I would also love to add more detailed world images instead of coding it into the html.
